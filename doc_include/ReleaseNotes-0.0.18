* Added interactive debugger capabilities (step into / step over / step out)!! ... It only took like 10 lines of code...why NOT add it? :-)
* Made :show_entire_method_body the default display_style since I like it better...
* code_for_entire_method: Made it a bit smarter about detecting beginning/end of method definition. Also works for define_method/do/end blocks now...
* Fixed minor display bug: was doing both chop_left and chop_right for file/line_num
